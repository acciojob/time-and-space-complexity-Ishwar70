    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Analyzing time complexity helps developers create more efficient programs that perform better, especially with large datasets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. A typical example of <b>Space Complexity</b> is O(n), which indicates that the memory used grows linearly with the input size.
